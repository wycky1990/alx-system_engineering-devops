<H1 align="center"> <ins> 500 Internal Server Error and 503 Service Unavailable Error</ins> </H1>

Upon the release of [**alx-system_engineering-devops**](https://github.com/wycky1990/alx-system_engineering-devops) project [**0x19. Postmortem**](https://intranet.alxswe.com/projects/294), approximately 06:00 **East African Time ** ***(EAT)*** here in **Nairobi** capital of **Kenya**, The firist one is an outage occurred on an isolated [**Ubuntu 14.04**](https://releases.ubuntu.com/focal) container running an Apache web server. GET requests on the server led to [**500 Internal Server Error's**](https://github.com/BekaHabesha/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x19-postmortem/README.md), when the expected response was an HTML file defining a simple [**Holberton WordPress site**](https://blog.holbertonschool.com/) and the second one [**The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 503 Service Unavailable server error**](https://github.com/BekaHabesha/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x19-postmortem/README.md) causes are a server that is down for maintenance or that is overloaded. This response code indicates that the server is not ready to handle the request. This response should be used for temporary conditions and the Retry-After HTTP header should, if possible, contain the estimated time for the recovery of the service.

<H1><ins>Debugging Process</ins> :heavy_check_mark:</H1>

* [**The Web UI Debug Window(Bug debugger Brennan)**](https://thebrennan.com/blogs/how-to-guides/the-web-ui-debug-window) (BDB... as in my actual initials... made that up on the spot, pretty good, huh?) encountered the issue upon opening the project and being, well, instructed to address it, roughly 19:20 PST. He promptly proceeded to undergo solving the problem.
  * 1. Checked running processes using <ins>**ps aux**</ins>. 
    * Two <ins>**apache2**</ins> processes - ${{\color{red}{\textsf{ root\ \}}}}\$ and ${{\color{red}{\textsf{ www\ \}}}}\$**-**${{\color{red}{\textsf{ data\ \}}}}\$ - were properly running.
  * 2. Looked in the ${{\color{red}{\textsf{ sites\ \}}}}\$**-**${{\color{red}{\textsf{ available\ \}}}}\$ folder of the <ins>**/etc/apache2/**</ins> Directory.
    * Determined that the ${{\color{red}{\textsf{ web\ \}}}}\$ ${{\color{red}{\textsf{ server\ \}}}}\$ was serving content located in <ins>**/var/www/html/**</ins>.
  * 3. In terminal one, ran ${{\color{red}{\textsf{ strace\ \}}}}\$ on the PID of the ${{\color{red}{\textsf{ root\ \}}}}\$ Apache process.
    * In the other terminal, curl the ${{\color{red}{\textsf{ server\ \}}}}\$. 
    * Expected great things... only to be disappointed. 
    * ${{\color{red}{\textsf{ strace\ \}}}}\$ gaves us no useful information.
  * 4. Repeated step 3, except on the **PID** of the ${{\color{red}{\textsf{ www\ \}}}}\$**-**${{\color{red}{\textsf{ data\ \}}}}\$ process. 
    * This time we Kept our expectations lower ... but was rewarded! 
      * ${{\color{red}{\textsf{ strace\ \}}}}\$ revelead an **-1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)** error occurring upon an attempt to access the file <ins>**/var/www/html/wp-includes/class-wp-locale.phpp</ins>**.
  * 5. Then Looked through files in the <ins>**/var/www/html/</ins>** Directory  one-by-one, 
    * using ${{\color{red}{\textsf{ Vi\ \}}}}\$ ${{\color{red}{\textsf{ pattern\ \}}}}\$ matching to try and locate the erroneous **.phpp** file extension. 
      * Located it in the <ins>**wp-settings.php</ins>** file. (Line 137, ***require_once( ABSPATH . WPINC . <ins>**/class-wp-locale.php</ins>** );***).
  * 6. Then Removed the trailing ${{\color{red}{\textsf{ p\ \}}}}\$ from the line.
  * 7. The we Tested another test using ${{\color{red}{\textsf{ curl\ \}}}}\$ command on the ${{\color{red}{\textsf{ server\ \}}}}\$. 
    * ${{\color{red}{\textsf{ 200\ \}}}}\$ ${{\color{red}{\textsf{ A\ \}}}}\$ **-ok!**
  * 8. Then Wrote a ${{\color{red}{\textsf{ Puppet\ \}}}}\$ ${{\color{red}{\textsf{ manifest\ \}}}}\$ to **automate <ins>fixing the error</ins>**.

<H1> <ins>Summation</ins> :heavy_check_mark:</H1>

In full, the <ins>**WordPress app</ins>** was encountering a critical error in [**wp-settings.php**](./https://intranet.alxswe.com/user_containers/648990/webterm/wp-settings.php) when tyring to load the file [**class-wp-locale.phpp**](https://intranet.alxswe.com/user_containers/648990/webterm/class-wp-locale.phpp). The correct file name, located in the ${{\color{red}{\textsf{ wp\ \}}}}\$**-**${{\color{red}{\textsf{ content\ \}}}}\$ Directory of the application folder , was [**class-wp-locale.php](https://intranet.alxswe.com/user_containers/648990/webterm/class-wp-locale.php).<br>
Patch involved a simple fix on removing the trailing ${{\color{red}{\textsf{ p\ \}}}}\$.

<H1> <ins>Prevention</ins> :heavy_check_mark:</H1>

* This outage was not a ${{\color{red}{\textsf{ web\ \}}}}\$ ${{\color{red}{\textsf{ server\ \}}}}\$ ${{\color{red}{\textsf{ error\ \}}}}\$, but it is an ${{\color{red}{\textsf{ application\ \}}}}\$ ${{\color{red}{\textsf{ error\ \}}}}\$. To prevent such outages moving forward, please keep the following in mind.
  * **ins>Test!</ins> <ins>Test</ins> <ins>Test</ins> <ins>Test</ins>** 
    * Test the ${{\color{red}{\textsf{ application\ \}}}}\$ before deploying. 
      * This ${{\color{red}{\textsf{ error\ \}}}}\$ would have arisen and could have been addressed earlier had the app been tested.
  * **<ins>Status monitoring</ins>** 
    * Enable some ${{\color{red}{\textsf{ uptime\ \}}}}\$**-**${{\color{red}{\textsf{ monitoring\ \}}}}\$ ${{\color{red}{\textsf{ service\ \}}}}\$ 
      * such as [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/) to alert instantly upon outage of the website.

> [!NOTE]
> Note that in response to this type of error, 
> I wrote a Puppet manifest [**0-strace_is_your_friend.pp**](https://github.com/BekaHabesha/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x17-web_stack_debugging_3/0-strace_is_your_friend.pp) 
> to automate fixing of any such identitical errors should they occur in the future. 
> The manifest replaces any **phpp** extensions in the file **/var/www/html/wp-settings.php** with **php**.

##

* **Resolution Details:** 
  * Increased the capacity of the authentication server pool to handle higher concurrent connections.
  * Implemented rate limiting to control the number of incoming requests and prevent server overload.
  * Refined the communication strategy to keep users informed about the situation.
